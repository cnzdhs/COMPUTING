Dear Mr Lee,
  I have always found your experiments fun and interesting.
  Be it separating a mixture through chromatography
  Or putting a raw quill egg in water,
  It was always fun and I would like to ask
  When will our next one be at?
  
  You have given us so much notes
  About SE, PCM, ECM, SS and ST
  As well as PNM, AS, CE, MS and LT
  And I would like to ask
  How much more will we get?
  How will the end result be like?
  
  So much homework, so many assignments,
  So many deadline extensions.
  But you still teach us
  And nurture us.
  
  You are our best Science teacher
  Irreplacable, responsible, kind and friendly
  I wonder how we could find
  Another teacher like you.
